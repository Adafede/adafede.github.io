Bio
======

*Adriano Rutz* is a pharmaceutical scientist.
After working in the analytical research laboratory and R&D department of Tradall SA (Bacardi Group), he obtained his
PhD in phytochemistry at the University of Geneva.
An advocate of open science
and [open data](https://akademien-schweiz.ch/en/current/news/adriano-rutz-gewinnt-ersten-schweizer-ord-preis), he is the
proud author of the [LOTUS initiative](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70780), a new way of sharing knowledge in natural
products research.
He is currently developing open computational tools and mass spectrometry-based strategies to better understand the
chemistry of living organisms.
