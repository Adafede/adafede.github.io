    "title": "Integrative Analytical and Computational Strategies for Qualitative and Semi-quantitative Plant Metabolome Characterization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "EnglishFrançaisDeutschItaliano\n\n\nThe detailed assessment of the composition of plant-derived products is of primary interest. The metabolites in natural extracts (NE) constitute the metabolome, which can be divided into the core and the specialized metabolome. Plants produce specialized metabolites to ensure their survival in a competitive environment. To assess the composition of NEs, currently validated methods for rigorous annotation and quantification of metabolites require standards. However, among the known metabolites, the availability of commercial reference standards is heavily restricted. Given this limitation, common analytical methods for NE composition assessment focus on studying a few specific and often non-bioactive markers.\nLiquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a method of choice for NE metabolite analysis. Annotating data sets generated by LC-MS systems remains challenging. Dereplication allows focusing efforts on novel compounds, overcoming this challenge by leveraging prior knowledge and computational tools. In the frame of the present thesis, two resources to improve dereplication were developed. The first is the Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation, which allows for better decision-making when multiple structural candidates are suggested by current MS-based annotation tools. The second is LOTUS, an initiative for open knowledge management in natural products research, that provides the largest collection of metabolite-taxon pairs.\nIn addition to annotation, semi-quantitative aspects are crucial for NE composition evaluation. They are needed to document the use of NEs as products and assess the presence and concentration level of potentially toxic compounds. Such information may also provide a rationale to justify specific molecules’ contribution to an extract’s overall bioactivity. Nevertheless, generic methods generating a semi-quantitative assessment of a large panel of metabolites are still lacking. Typically, only a dozen metabolites account for most of the extract’s mass, while hundreds are present in trace amounts.\nTherefore, effective procedures providing a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome of NEs are needed, further addressing both qualitative and quantitative aspects. This work combines qualitative and semi-quantitative information in an automated manner, by integrating LC-MS-based metabolite profiling with generic universal detection methods. The impact of this strategy is evaluated on public data, collaborations, and well-known plants. Its application to different research questions is illustrated, i.e. through flavoring plants of industrial interest such as Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) H. Karst, containing large quantities of bitter principles. The presented workflow, integrating analytical and computational strategies, aims to make plant metabolomics research more effective for public health, food and beverage safety, as well as fundamental science.\n\n\nL’évaluation détaillée de la composition des produits dérivés des plantes est d’intérêt primordial. Les métabolites présents dans les extraits naturels (NE) constituent le métabolome, qui peut être divisé en métabolome principal et métabolome spécialisé. Les plantes produisent des métabolites spécialisés pour assurer leur survie dans un environnement compétitif. Pour évaluer la composition des NE, les méthodes actuellement validées pour l’annotation et la quantification rigoureuses des métabolites nécessitent des standards. Cependant, parmi les métabolites connus, la disponibilité de standards de référence commerciaux est fortement limitée. Compte tenu de cette limitation, les méthodes analytiques courantes pour l’évaluation de la composition du NE se fondent sur l’étude de quelques marqueurs spécifiques et souvent non bioactifs.\nLa chromatographie liquide couplée à la spectrométrie de masse (LC-MS) est une méthode de choix pour l’analyse des métabolites de NE. L’annotation des données générées par ces systèmes LC-MS reste un défi. La déréplication permet de concentrer les efforts sur des composés nouveaux, surmontant ce défi en tirant parti des connaissances antérieures et des outils informatiques. Dans le cadre de la présente thèse, deux ressources visant à améliorer la déréplication ont été développées. La première est l’Annotation de Metabolites Informée Taxonomiquement, qui permet une meilleure prise de décision lorsque de multiples candidats structurels sont suggérés par les outils d’annotation actuels basés sur la MS. Le second est LOTUS, une initiative pour la gestion ouverte des connaissances dans la recherche sur les produits naturels, qui fournit la plus grande collection de paires métabolite-taxon.\nOutre l’annotation, les aspects semi-quantitatifs sont cruciaux pour l’évaluation de la composition des NE. Ils sont nécessaires pour documenter l’utilisation des NE en tant que produits et évaluer la présence et le niveau de concentration de composés potentiellement toxiques.

    "title": "Integrative Analytical and Computational Strategies for Qualitative and Semi-quantitative Plant Metabolome Characterization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "EnglishFrançaisDeutschItaliano\n\n\nThe detailed assessment of the composition of plant-derived products is of primary interest. The metabolites in natural extracts (NE) constitute the metabolome, which can be divided into the core and the specialized metabolome. Plants produce specialized metabolites to ensure their survival in a competitive environment. To assess the composition of NEs, currently validated methods for rigorous annotation and quantification of metabolites require standards. However, among the known metabolites, the availability of commercial reference standards is heavily restricted. Given this limitation, common analytical methods for NE composition assessment focus on studying a few specific and often non-bioactive markers.\nLiquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a method of choice for NE metabolite analysis. Annotating data sets generated by LC-MS systems remains challenging. Dereplication allows focusing efforts on novel compounds, overcoming this challenge by leveraging prior knowledge and computational tools. In the frame of the present thesis, two resources to improve dereplication were developed. The first is the Taxonomically Informed Metabolite Annotation, which allows for better decision-making when multiple structural candidates are suggested by current MS-based annotation tools. The second is LOTUS, an initiative for open knowledge management in natural products research, that provides the largest collection of metabolite-taxon pairs.\nIn addition to annotation, semi-quantitative aspects are crucial for NE composition evaluation. They are needed to document the use of NEs as products and assess the presence and concentration level of potentially toxic compounds. Such information may also provide a rationale to justify specific molecules’ contribution to an extract’s overall bioactivity. Nevertheless, generic methods generating a semi-quantitative assessment of a large panel of metabolites are still lacking. Typically, only a dozen metabolites account for most of the extract’s mass, while hundreds are present in trace amounts.\nTherefore, effective procedures providing a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome of NEs are needed, further addressing both qualitative and quantitative aspects. This work combines qualitative and semi-quantitative information in an automated manner, by integrating LC-MS-based metabolite profiling with generic universal detection methods. The impact of this strategy is evaluated on public data, collaborations, and well-known plants. Its application to different research questions is illustrated, i.e. through flavoring plants of industrial interest such as Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) H. Karst, containing large quantities of bitter principles. The presented workflow, integrating analytical and computational strategies, aims to make plant metabolomics research more effective for public health, food and beverage safety, as well as fundamental science.\n\n\nL’évaluation détaillée de la composition des produits dérivés des plantes est d’intérêt primordial. Les métabolites présents dans les extraits naturels (NE) constituent le métabolome, qui peut être divisé en métabolome principal et métabolome spécialisé. Les plantes produisent des métabolites spécialisés pour assurer leur survie dans un environnement compétitif. Pour évaluer la composition des NE, les méthodes actuellement validées pour l’annotation et la quantification rigoureuses des métabolites nécessitent des standards. Cependant, parmi les métabolites connus, la disponibilité de standards de référence commerciaux est fortement limitée. Compte tenu de cette limitation, les méthodes analytiques courantes pour l’évaluation de la composition du NE se fondent sur l’étude de quelques marqueurs spécifiques et souvent non bioactifs.\nLa chromatographie liquide couplée à la spectrométrie de masse (LC-MS) est une méthode de choix pour l’analyse des métabolites de NE. L’annotation des données générées par ces systèmes LC-MS reste un défi. La déréplication permet de concentrer les efforts sur des composés nouveaux, surmontant ce défi en tirant parti des connaissances antérieures et des outils informatiques. Dans le cadre de la présente thèse, deux ressources visant à améliorer la déréplication ont été développées. La première est l’Annotation de Metabolites Informée Taxonomiquement, qui permet une meilleure prise de décision lorsque de multiples candidats structurels sont suggérés par les outils d’annotation actuels basés sur la MS. Le second est LOTUS, une initiative pour la gestion ouverte des connaissances dans la recherche sur les produits naturels, qui fournit la plus grande collection de paires métabolite-taxon.\nOutre l’annotation, les aspects semi-quantitatifs sont cruciaux pour l’évaluation de la composition des NE. Ils sont nécessaires pour documenter l’utilisation des NE en tant que produits et évaluer la présence et le niveau de concentration de composés potentiellement toxiques. Ces informations peuvent également permettre de justifier la contribution de molécules spécifiques à la bioactivité globale d’un extrait. Néanmoins, il n’existe toujours pas de méthodes génériques permettant une évaluation semi-quantitative d’un large panel de métabolites. Typiquement, seule une douzaine de métabolites représentent la majeure partie de la masse de l’extrait, tandis que des centaines sont présents à l’état de traces.\nIl est donc nécessaire de mettre au point des procédures efficaces permettant une analyse complète du métabolome des NE, en tenant compte des aspects qualitatifs et quantitatifs.
