title: "Open Science Upgrade: Adding Blog Posts to my Website and Linking to Rogue Scholar"

I have finally opened a `Posts` section on my website!
Every post should now automatically get a DOI.

This is something I have wanted to do for a long time, largely inspired by the tireless and consistent example set by [Egon Willighagen](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q20895241) [@cites:willighagen2024a; @cites:willighagen2024b; @cites:willighagen2025].

It was today's post of [@obtains_background_from:fenner2025] that finally motivated me to look into it again.
That led me down a productive rabbit hole to set up Rogue Scholar: first landing on [@obtains_background_from:voncsefalvay2023]'s excellent guide, and then [@uses_method_in:fruehwald2025]’s clear write-up, both of which made the process of integrating Rogue Scholar into a Quarto-based site surprisingly smooth.

All the changes are documented in the following commit:

<https://github.com/Adafede/adafede.github.io/commit/bc2dfe6f>

If you care about attribution, long-term archiving, DOIs and metadata, I highly recommend looking into [Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/).

**Edit:** I realized that integrating [CiTO](https://sparontologies.github.io/cito/current/cito.html) could be a significant enhancement.
With some effort (and thanks again to Egon), I managed to implement a working solution for the HTML and PDF outputs, see [@uses_method_in:willighagen2023]. 
However, the solution for the XML feed still feels suboptimal.
